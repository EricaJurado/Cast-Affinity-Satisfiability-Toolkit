# Amelia's Birthday Party

In this game, a girl named Amelia and her mom have just moved to a new town.
Amelia is going to a new school, and doesn't yet have any friends in her
classroom. Her mom decides to throw Amelia a birthday party, and invited
students from Amelia's class to the party. 

## Goal of the Game

You play the game as Amelia at her birthday party. Amelia's goal is to have fun
at her party doing activities she enjoys, and also to make at least one friend
by the end of the party. Characters in the game have different personality
traits and interests. The level of affinity between charachters based on these
factors can influence their ability to form friendships. 

## Personality

Since children's friendships are often based around shared interests and
activities, we include hobbies in the charachters' "personality" profiles. 
Each charachter has a score of 1-10 in the following categories:

### Traits

#### shy / assertive

#### calm / energetic


### Interests

#### sports

#### craft

#### video games

Each time the game is played, the classmates generated will vary, resulting in
a unique playing experience.
